# wolframalpha-slack-bot

Inspired by friend Tony's https://github.com/tonyprawiro/wolfram-alpha-telegram-bot

A very simple Slack Bot to query Wolfram Alpha

Just key in your "Slack Bot token", "slack chat room" and "Wolfram Alpha AppID" into the source, and then run it.

Then speak to your bot, and start asking it funny questions
